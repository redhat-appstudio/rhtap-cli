Red Hat Trusted Application Pipeline Installer (`rhtap-cli`)
------------------------------------------------------------

# Overview

The `rhtap-cli` is designed as a sophisticated installer for Kubernetes [Helm Charts][helm], addressing the complexity of managing interdependent resources in Kubernetes environments. Unlike Kubernetes, which orchestrates resources individually without acknowledging their interdependencies, `rhtap-cli` enhances the deployment process by considering these relationships, thereby improving the user experience.

This CLI leverages a [`config.yaml`](config.yaml) file to sequence Helm Chart deployments meticulously. It ensures the integrity of each deployment phase by executing a comprehensive test suite before proceeding to the next Chart installation. This methodical approach guarantees that each phase is successfully completed, enhancing reliability and stability.

Helm, serving as the foundation of `rhtap-cli`, provides a detailed blueprint of resources within Kubernetes. This allows for thorough inspection and troubleshooting of deployment issues, offering users detailed documentation and tips for resolution. By integrating with Helm Charts, `rhtap-cli` not only adheres to industry standards but also opens the door to more sophisticated features, further enriching the deployment experience.

The `rhtap-cli` is designed to be user-friendly, providing a seamless installation process for users of all skill levels. 

# Configuration Overview

The `config.yaml` file is structured to outline key components essential for the setup:

```yaml
---
rhtapCLI:
  namespace: rhtap
  features: {}
  dependencies: {}
```

The attributes of the `rhtapCLI` object are as follows:

- `.namespace`: Specifies the default namespace used by the installer, set to rhtap. This namespace acts as the primary operational area for the installation process.
- `.features`: Defines the features to be deployed by the installer. Each feature is identified by a unique name and a set of properties.
- `.dependencies`: Specifies the dependencies rolled out by the installer in the specific order defined in the configuration file.

## `rhtapCLI.features`

Defines the features the installer will deploy. Each feature is defined by a unique name and a set of properties. For instance, the following snippet defines a `featureName` block:

```yaml
---
rhtapCLI:
  features:
    featureName:
      enabled: true
      namespace: namespace
      properties:
        key: value
```

With the following attributes:
- `enabled`: A boolean value to toggle the unique feature
- `namespace`: The namespace in which the feature will be deployed
- `properties`: A set of key-value pairs to define the feature's properties

This data can be leveraged for templating using the [`values.yaml.tpl`](#template-functions) file.

## `rhtapCLI.dependencies`

```yaml
rhtapCLI:
  dependencies:
    - chart: path/to/chart/directory 
      namespace: namespace
      enabled: true
```

# Template Functions

The following functions are available for use in the `values.yaml.tpl` file:

## `{{ .Installer.Features.* }}`

- `{{ .Installer.Features.*.Enabled }}`: Returns the boolean value of the feature's `enabled` field.
- `{{ .Installer.Features.*.Namespace }}`: Returns the namespace in which the feature will be deployed.
- `{{ .Installer.Features.*.Properties.*}}`: Returns a dictionary of key-value pairs for the feature's properties.

## `{{ .OpenShift.Ingress }}`

Helper function to inspect the target cluster's Ingress configuration.

```yaml
{{- $ingressDomain := required "OpenShift ingress domain" .OpenShift.Ingress.Domain -}}
---
developerHub:
  ingressDomain: {{ $ingressDomain }}
```
